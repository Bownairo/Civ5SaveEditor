# Civ5SaveEditor
Modifies Civilization 5 saves to enable and disable pitboss mode when not allowed.

Allows Civ5Saves to be modified to pitboss mode when the game doesn't allow it.
Saves without pitboss mode enabled will be modified to have pitboss enabled.
Saves with pitboss mode enabled will be modified to have pitboss disabled.

This allows for Civ 5 games to be started in a local multiplayer mode, and then hosted as a pitboss server
to continue play when simultaneous play is not a posibility.
